## Description:

This is an AWS system diagram requested in the Solutions Architect Associate course class. The problem involves: Company X, a large online retailer, is experiencing difficulties with the scalability and availability of its current IT system. With the increase in online transactions and the expansion of its digital services, the company decided to migrate to a cloud solution to improve the performance, security and flexibility of its infrastructure.

Expected result: Migrate Company X's IT infrastructure to the cloud, implementing a scalable and secure solution that supports future growth and improves the customer experience. The group must create a diagram of what the AWS structure would look like, with services that the group believes are ideal.
